A fun little problem I heard in lab the other day: Given a 2D array of integers,
you want to efficiently get the sum of a large number of arbitrary rectangles
within it. The key is to generate the prefix sums for all rectangles starting
at (0, 0), then compute the area of any rectangle in terms of these. This, you
need linear precomputation time and space (in number of elements of the array),
and can then find the sum of any rectangle in constant time.
